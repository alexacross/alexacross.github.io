<p style="color:orange;">Halloween is a holiday celebrated in a multitude of countries on the last day of October every year and was considered as the dedicated time to remember the deceased. Its many traditions have originated from ancient Celtic Harvest Festivals and dates back to about 1745. Today, many forms of celebration include trick-or- treating, costume parties, jack-o-latern making, bonfires, and paying visits to haunted houses and other attractions. </p>
