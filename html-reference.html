<h3>Header</h3>
<p>The tag for the header is &lthead&gt;. This tag defines information about the document and is a container for metadata. A  &lthead&gt; tag is located above the title tag where as a &lt/head&gt; tag is under the title tag. </p> 

<h3>Title</h3>

<h3>Heading</h3>
<p>Heading tags are represented by &lth1&gt;, &lth2&gt;, etc. They are used for a range of reasons, such as to show document structure and allow search engines to index the structure and content of the webpage.

<h3>Breaks</h3>
