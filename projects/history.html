    <h2>Three Kings</h2>
    <p><img src="http://mamiverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/5-Bible-Verses-That-Celebrate-the-BIrth-of-Jesus-MainPhoto.jpg" style="float:right;width:150px;height:115px;">The Three Kings, also referred to as the Three Wise Men, were in the Gospel of Matthew and Christian tradition, a group of distinguished foreigners who visited Jesus after his birth, bearing gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. They are regular figures in traditional accounts of the nativity celebrations of Christmas and are an important part of Christian tradition. Traditionally, these kings are depicted visiting infant Jesus on the night of his birth in a manger accompanied by the shepherds and angels</p>

    <h2>The Birth of Jesus Christ</h2>
    <p><img src="http://christian.expert/sites/default/files/inline-images/birth-Jesus.jpg" style="float:right;width:200px;height:145px;">About 2,000 years ago, God sent down Angel Gabriel to a young woman named Mary, where he informed her that she would become pregnant by the Holy Spirit and give birth to a baby boy known as Jesus. He was to be God's own Son, the Savior of all, and would be the only man born by a virgin. Among recieving this information, Mary and her husband, Joseph, decided to travel from Nazareth to Bethleham, for that is where Joseph's family lived.</p>
    <p>Among reaching Bethleham, the couple had a difficult time finding somewhere to stay. With the time limitation from Mary's soon labor, they decided to settle in a barn. It was within this barn on the night of Christmas day that baby Jesus was born.</p>

    <h2>The Star of Bethleham</h2>
    <p>The Star of Bethleham alerted the three wise men of the birth of Christ, acting as a catalyst for them to make the long trek to Jerusalem; it leads them to Jesus' home in the town, where they worship Him and give Him many gifts. Many Christians believe the star was a miraculous sign to mark the birth of the Christ in His honor, although astronomers have other attempts at defining the cause of this star, including a  supernova.  </p>
